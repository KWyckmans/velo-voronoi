# velo-voronoi

The city of Antwerp has a bike sharing system that is widely used throughout the city. They provide various datasets through their
opendata API. Tried to play with a voronoi diagram of available bike stations (what's the closest bike station from any given position?).
Did not do anything smart, just created the visualisation. To become actually useful, it would need to take into account actual streets 
and not birds-eye view polygons. In its current state, while not useful, it is pretty. 

The dataset used is outdated, since many stations have been added since I started this project. I will most definitely not follow-up on
this.
